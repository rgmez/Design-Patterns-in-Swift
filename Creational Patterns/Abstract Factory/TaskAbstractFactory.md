# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Introduction
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that extends the concept of factory methods. It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when a system needs to integrate with multiple families of related products or when it's designed to be extensible with new product families.

## Characteristics

### 1. Group of Related Products
- Unlike the simple Factory Pattern that creates single products, the Abstract Factory Pattern is used to create families of related or dependent products.

### 2. High-Level Abstraction of Object Creation
- The Abstract Factory Pattern abstracts not just the creation of objects but the creation of families of related objects. Clients work with product interfaces and factories, remaining completely unaware of the concrete classes required to instantiate these objects.

### 3. Facilitates Consistency Among Products
- Ensures that products that are meant to be used together can be combined without issues. This consistency is hard to achieve with simple factory or constructor methods.

### 4. Decoupling and Extensibility
- Like the Factory Pattern, it helps decouple product implementations from the client code. It goes further by allowing easy extension with new product families without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

## Use Cases
- When the system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- When the system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- When a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.

## Example in Swift
In our Swift code example, the Abstract Factory Pattern is used to create different types of tasks (`SimpleTask`, `RecurringTask`, `DeadlineTask`). The pattern is implemented through a protocol `TaskFactoryProtocol` and a concrete factory `TaskFactory`. The `TaskFactoryProtocol` defines methods for creating different types of tasks, and `TaskFactory` implements these methods to return the respective task types. 

The `TaskManager` class is responsible for managing tasks using a factory. It can create various types of tasks by calling methods on the factory, which then returns the specific task instances based on the provided `TaskType`. This abstraction allows for easy addition of new task types and task creation processes without modifying the client code that uses the factory.

For a practical implementation, see the Swift code in [TaskAbstractFactory.swift](./TaskAbstractFactory.swift).
