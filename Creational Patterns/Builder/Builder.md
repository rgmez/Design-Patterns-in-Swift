# Builder Design Pattern

## Introduction
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction process of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## Characteristics

### 1. Step-by-Step Construction
- The Builder Pattern allows building a complex object in a stepwise fashion. It provides control over the construction process.

### 2. Encapsulation of Construction Logic
- The pattern encapsulates the way a complex object is constructed, thereby hiding the details from the client.

### 3. Creation of Different Representations
- The Builder Pattern allows different representations of the constructed object, enhancing flexibility.

## When to Use

- When the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
- When the construction process must allow different representations for the constructed object.
- When there's a need to isolate the code for construction and representation of a complex object.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits
- Provides finer control over the construction process.
- Supports constructing complex objects with numerous attributes.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.

### Drawbacks
- Can lead to increased code complexity due to the additional builder classes.
- Might introduce additional layers of abstraction, which could complicate the code.

## Example in Swift
The Builder Pattern is implemented in the [TaskBuilder.swift](./TaskBuilder.swift) file. This example demonstrates the construction of a `Task` object in a task management system, showcasing the step-by-step building process facilitated by the Builder Pattern. It includes the definition of a `Task` structure, along with the associated `TaskType` and `Priority` enums, and the `TaskBuilder` class that follows the Builder Pattern for creating `Task` instances with various attributes.
