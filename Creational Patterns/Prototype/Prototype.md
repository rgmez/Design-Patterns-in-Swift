# Prototype Creational Pattern

## Introduction
The Prototype Creational Pattern is a design pattern that enables creating new objects by cloning an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is useful in scenarios where object creation is costly, and a similar object already exists.

## Characteristics

### 1. Cloning Mechanism
- The core of the Prototype Pattern is the cloning mechanism, where each object is capable of creating a duplicate of itself.

### 2. Reducing Creation Complexity
- The pattern simplifies object creation, particularly when dealing with complex object structures or costly instantiation processes.

### 3. Flexibility in Object Variation
- It provides flexibility in creating varied objects, allowing modifications after cloning to adapt to specific needs.

### 4. Avoiding Subclassing
- Unlike other creational patterns, the Prototype Pattern avoids the need for subclassing, instead relying on object composition.

## Use Cases
- When the types of objects to create are determined dynamically at runtime.
- In situations where reducing the overhead of new instantiation is crucial.
- When a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.

## Example in Swift
In the provided Swift code example, we demonstrate the Prototype Pattern using a `Task` struct. Each `Task` instance can create a clone of itself, simplifying the creation of new task instances with similar attributes.

For a practical implementation, see the Swift code in [TaskPrototype.swift](./TaskPrototype.swift).
