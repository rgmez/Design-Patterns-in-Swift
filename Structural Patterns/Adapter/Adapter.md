# Adapter Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two different interfaces or classes, enabling them to communicate without modifying their existing code. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating new features, APIs, or systems that do not match the existing system's interface.

## Characteristics

1. **Interface Compatibility:** The Adapter Pattern makes two different interfaces compatible without changing their existing code. This promotes reusability and flexibility.
   
2. **Single Responsibility Principle:** It follows the Single Responsibility Principle by separating the conversion or adaptation logic into its own class, thereby keeping the system clean and organized.
   
3. **Enhanced Flexibility:** By decoupling the client and the class of the object to be adapted, it enhances the system's flexibility, allowing for functionality to be added or changed without affecting existing code.
   
4. **Simplifies Integration:** It simplifies the integration of classes that couldn't otherwise work together due to incompatible interfaces. This is particularly useful when dealing with third-party libraries or legacy systems.

## Use Cases

- When you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.
- In the integration of new features, APIs, or systems without disturbing the existing infrastructure.
- When you need to provide several different interfaces to the same class.

## Example in Swift

In our Swift example, we demonstrated the Adapter Pattern by integrating an `ExternalTaskService` with a different interface (`taskName`, `taskDetail`, `isCompleted`) into an existing system expecting a `Task` protocol (`title`, `description`). The `ExternalTaskAdapter` served as a bridge, adapting the `ExternalTaskService` to the `Task` protocol, enabling seamless integration without altering the original code or the external service.

For a practical implementation, see the Swift code in `ExternalTaskAdapter.swift`.
