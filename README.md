# 📘 Swift Design Patterns Repository

## 🌟 Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring various design patterns used in Swift programming. It serves as a guide for both novice and experienced developers to understand and implement design patterns effectively in their Swift projects.

### 🏗 Creational Patterns
These patterns are all about class instantiation. They can be divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
- 🏭 **Factory Method** - [TaskFactory.swift](./Creational%20Patterns/Factory/TaskFactory.md).
- 🏭 **Abstract Factory** - [TaskAstractFactory.swift](./Creational%20Patterns/Abstract%20Factory/TaskAbstractFactory.md).
- 🛠 **Builder** - [TaskBuilder.swift](./Creational%20Patterns/Builder/Builder.md).
- 🤖 **Prototype** - [TaskPrototype.swift](./Creational%20Patterns/Prototype/Prototype.md).

### 🌉 Structural Patterns
These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
- 🔌 **Adapter** - [ExternalTaskFactory.swift](./Structural%20Patterns/Adapter/Adapter.md).
- 🌁 **Bridge** - [TaskExecutionModes.swift](Structural%20Patterns/Bridge.md)
- 🧱 **Composite** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 🚧 - We are actively working on this and will update it asap!.
- 🎨 **Decorator** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#)
- 🏢 **Facade** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 🪶 **Flyweight** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 🛡️ **Proxy** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 

### 🧠 Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- 👀 **Observer** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 🤝 **Mediator** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 👣 **Visitor** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 💻 **Command** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 📊 **State** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 🕹️ **Strategy** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#) 
- 📜 **Memento** - [Update scheduled in sequence](#)
